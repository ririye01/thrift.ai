# Thrift.ai: An Intuitive Image-Based Clothing Classifier

Thrift.ai is a project currently being developed using the DeepFashion dataset. This project is intended to start out as a Swift-based mobile app containing an MLOps component where we utilize the iPhone camera to detect clothing and show the user similar clothes from a multitude of selected online retailors. We want to use this app as a way to infer a user's preferred clothing style using images they take and interpret accordingly what kind of clothes they would like to show based on the clothes they pass in that they like.
